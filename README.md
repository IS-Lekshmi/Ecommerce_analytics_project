# 🛒 E-Commerce Customer Purchase Behavior Analysis

## 📌 Problem
How can an e-commerce company improve retention, reduce churn, and optimize revenue?

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, SQLite) on Google Colab
- Power BI (Dashboard visualization)
- GitHub (Project hosting)

## 📊 Process
1. Cleaned & merged datasets (orders, customers, payments, products).
2. Performed SQL queries in Colab to analyze customer purchase behavior.
3. Built features like Customer Lifetime Value.
4. Visualized KPIs in Power BI (Revenue, Retention, Churn, Delivery Delays).

## 📈 Insights
-Generated $16.1M revenue from ~96K orders across 93K customers (low repeat purchase rate → need loyalty programs).

-Revenue dipped after September, indicating seasonality or weak Q4 promotions.

-Top cities: São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Belo Horizonte, Brasília → revenue concentrated in urban hubs.

-Best-selling categories: Home goods & electronics → opportunity for cross-selling bundles.

-Credit cards dominate (76%) → suggest expanding installment plans to boost AOV.

-Achieved only 22% of revenue target → targets may be unrealistic or require stronger campaigns.
